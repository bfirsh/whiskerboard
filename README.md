Whiskerboard
============

Whiskerboard is a status board for websites, services and APIs, like Amazon's [AWS status page](http://status.aws.amazon.com/).

It is heavily based on [Stashboard](http://www.stashboard.org/). Unlike Stashboard, it uses vanilla Django, so you aren't stuck using Google App Engine.

Have a look at the demo: [http://status.lolnet.org/](http://status.lolnet.org/).

Quick start guide
-----------------

It's quick to get a status board up and running.
    
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

You might need to install [pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html). If you haven't got a virtualenv, you'll need to run it as root too.

Back on the admin home page, click on "services" and add the things you want to report the status of (website, API etc). To change the status of a service add an event for it.

Your configuration
------------------

You now need to configure your application. To do so, you can copy the
`local.py.dist` file to `local.py`, or create a `deploy.py` file, depending on
what you are doing (development versus deploiement)::

    $ cp settings/local.py{.dist,}

and of course edit it with your own settings.

First run
---------

On the first run, you need to synchronize the database and run the migrations::

    $ python manage.py syncdb
    $ python manage.py migrate

Adding services checks
----------------------

Whiskerboard wasn't originally made to check the availability of the services,
but it now supports q way to do so, by using celery checks. If you need it, 
you'll need to:

- Install celery and django-celery to your virtual environment;
- Add `djcelery` to the INSTALLED_APPS list in your settings;
- add a `connection_string` value to your services; it should be of the form
  `protocol://host:port` (protocol can be ping, http or https for now);
- run celeryd (with `python manage.py celeryd`) in the background;
- run the `check_status` task periodically, when you want to check that the
  services are still up.

Here is the line to put in your crontab (`crontab -e`) if you want to check
things hourly::

    @hourly /path/to/venv/bin/python public/manage.py check_status
